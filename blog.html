                      <p class="lead">The physical environment of a person can also trigger dormant mental health issues or create new ones,
                        especially with adolescents since their brains and bodies are still developing.
                         Multiple outside sources can be the cause, outdoor physical environments, housing, or people and relationships. 
                         When the brain is still developing it is easily influenced by the people around it. 
                         If a young person is constantly being ridiculed, bullied, or singled out by their peers they will most likely 
                         start to develop low self-esteem and other mental issues.</p>

                        <h2>Support them!</h2>
                        <p>A child's healthy development relies on their 
                            parents because they are the first source of support and care. 
                            Kids need to feel loved, nurtured, and accepted; they need to 
                            have the security that they can count on their parents when in 
                            tough situations. They need someone to rely on because kids 
                            don’t quite know yet how to defend themselves or know how to 
                            practice healthy coping mechanisms.<br> When a parent is present 
                            but absent emotionally “The child will feel rejected regularly” 
                            (How to avoid the trap of present but absent parenting).
                            The parenting technique to let a baby “cry it out” the child handle the situation by themself. 
                            This method of parenting is harmful and leaves the child feeling neglected, 
                            “those whose needs go unmet will become mistrustful and struggle with feelings 
                            of insecurity and worthlessness”(How an emotionally absent mother impacts her 
                            daughter's life). <br>Many parents believe that bullying or ridicule from their peers is a part of growing 
                            up, but it only causes harm when the parents don't get step in to protect their child. 
                            It’s almost impossible for a young child to healthily develop and learn how to 
                            properly deal with mental issues because their emotions were ignored at such a young age.

                        <h2>Pay attention!</h2>
                        <p>Many parents don’t monitor their children or are simply unaware of the dangers of the media. 
                            So when kids fall into these holes they are often unprotected from the harsh reality of life and people. 
                            They can be exposed to cyber bullying, as discussed previously, and without protection from their parents they are 
                            stuck fending for themselves.<br>
                            Start by noticing the moods, emotions, and behaviors. 
                            Early harm intervention, especially with signs of it, 
                            is critical because mental health conditions often worsen 
                            without treatment. If noticing symptoms, schedule an 
                            appointment with a licensed psychiatrist as soon as possible, 
                            or if that is not possible, then the pediatrician or primary 
                            care physician. Make sure that healthcare professionals are 
                            given as much detailed information.<br> If the child reports seeing 
                            or hearing things that are not there, without the influence of 
                            drugs or alcohol, then seek medical treatment immediately. 
                            With that being said, continue helping them by educating yourself 
                            as much as possible about their mental health condition. 
                            One website that can benefit the child when educating yourself is 
                            NAMI Basics. NAMI Basics is an educational class that teaches parents 
                            and other family caregivers how to cope with their child’s condition and manage their recovery.</p>
